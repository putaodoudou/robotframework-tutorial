Documentation    A test case that moves away from the Selenium2Library and uses the BuiltIn
...              and the String libraries. NOTE how fast the test executes and also note
...              how keywords can be written as Gherkin style BDD tests!
...
...              Those with a keen eye would have also noticed that ALL variables have been set as
...              as suite variables and that the final keyword is a convoluted conditional block.
...              Those with an even keener eye would have noticed that this test is self contained
...              and does not import any resource file.

*** Keywords ***
A Randomly Generated String
    ${random}=            Generate Random String
    Set Suite Variable    ${random}

The Character Count Is Less Than 10
    ${count}=    Get Length    ${random}
    Set Suite Variable         ${count}

The String Does Not Contain "e"
    ${status}=    Run Keyword And Return Status    Should Not Contain    ${random}    e
    Set Suite Variable    ${status}

Convert String To Uppercase
    ${random}=    Run Keyword If    ${count} < 10 and ${status} == True    Convert To Uppercase    ${random}
